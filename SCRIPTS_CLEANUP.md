## ‚úÖ Scripts Kept (6 total)

### Essential Scripts
1. **`backend/start.sh`**
   - Used by Docker container
   - Contains health checks for PostgreSQL and Redis
   - Required for container startup

2. **`start-dev.sh`**
   - Main development startup script
   - Checks API keys configuration
   - Manages Docker Compose services
   - Primary way to start development environment

3. **`cleanup.sh`**
   - Comprehensive cleanup utility
   - Multiple cleanup options (ports, docker, deps, data, logs)
   - Well-documented with safety checks

4. **`check-status.sh`**
   - Service status monitoring
   - Shows running services and ports
   - Useful for debugging

5. **`shutdown-all.sh`**
   - Clean shutdown of all services
   - Companion to start-dev.sh

6. **`start.sh`**
   - Flexible startup with options
   - Can start individual services
   - Good for selective service management

## üìù Usage Guide

### Starting Development
```bash
./start-dev.sh              # Start everything
./start.sh backend          # Start only backend
./start.sh docker          # Start only Docker services
```

### Checking Status
```bash
./check-status.sh          # See what's running
docker-compose ps          # Check Docker containers
```

### Stopping Services
```bash
./shutdown-all.sh          # Stop everything gracefully
docker-compose down        # Stop Docker containers
```

### Cleaning Up
```bash
./cleanup.sh ports         # Free up ports
./cleanup.sh docker        # Stop containers
./cleanup.sh all           # Clean everything except data
./cleanup.sh full          # Clean everything (DANGEROUS!)
```

## üéØ Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Confusion**: No duplicate scripts with similar names
2. **Clear Purpose**: Each remaining script has a distinct role
3. **Docker-First**: Removed virtual environment scripts in favor of containers
4. **Current Architecture**: Removed scripts that don't match production setup
5. **Simplified Maintenance**: Fewer scripts to maintain and update

## üí° Recommendations

1. Always use `start-dev.sh` for development startup
2. Use `cleanup.sh` when switching branches or debugging
3. Check `check-status.sh` if something seems wrong
4. Keep scripts updated with any architecture changes
